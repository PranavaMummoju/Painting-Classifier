PROJECT:
Build your own database of minimum 260 paintings listed on: 
http://www.saatchiart.com/paintings/fine-art 
You have to use the following classification features describing these 
paintings: name of painting, artist name, size (if for instance 48"x64",
then use 3072 = 48x64), price, number of views, number of favorites, 
date, subject (http://www.art.com/shop/art-subjects/), medium 
(watercolor, canvas, oil, mixed media,...). Also, you have to propose 
minimum 4 new features for describing these paintings. When your DB is 
built, take price as the decision feature and split it into 3 intervals 
(discretize it) in a way that resulting classifiers have highest 
precission (use WEKA for classifiers construction). Your classifiers 
should not use artist name nor name of painting as a classification 
feature.
